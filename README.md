# Canvas Test
My first multiplayer canvas game using Socket-io.

## About
This was my first one of my first nodeJs projects. I wanted to create a multiplayer environment where a user could see other users moving on the screen.

I used socket-io to handle send data between the server and clients.

## Installation

Initialize npm
```
npm install
```

Start server
```
npm start
```

You can access the game on **localhost:3000**, or on your computers ip address if you with to connect on a different computer.
